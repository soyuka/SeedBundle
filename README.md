## Why

I needed something to load seed data that needed to stay in database. The only symfony bundle that could be used for this is the [DoctrineFixturesBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineFixturesBundle). Those are fixtures, and should be used for testing only. Data included with this are removed/purged when the command is launched. Here, I want the data to be persistent.
You can use it as a fixture bundle too by `unloading` data, but it is not it's main purpose.

## Configuration

```yaml
soyuka_seed:
  prefix: 'seed' #command prefix "seed:yourseedname"
  directory: 'Seeds' #default seed path: Bundle/Seeds
  separator: ':'
```

## Building a Seed

The `Seed` class is a `Command` and :

- Must extend `Soyuka\SeedBundle\Command\Seed`
- Must have a class name that ends by `Seed`
- Must call `setSeedName` in the configure method

```php
<?php

namespace AcmeBundle\ISOBundle\Seeds;

use Soyuka\SeedBundle\Command\Seed;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;

use Symfony\Component\Yaml\Parser;
use AcmeBundle\ISOBundle\Entity\Country;

class CountrySeed extends Seed
{

    protected function configure()
    {
        //The seed won't load if this is not set
        //The resulting command will be {prefix}:country
        $this
            ->setSeedName('country');

        parent::configure();
    }

    public function load(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output){

        //Doctrine logging eats a lot of memory, this is a wrapper to disable logging
        $this->disableDoctrineLogging();

        //Access doctrine through $this->doctrine
        $countryRepository = $this->doctrine->getRepository('AcmeISOBundle:Country');

        $yaml = new Parser();

        //for example, using umpirsky/country-list (lazy yaml)
        $countries = $yaml->parse(file_get_contents('vendor/umpirsky/country-list/country/cldr/fr/country.yaml'));

        foreach ($countries as $id => $country) {

            if($countryRepository->findOneById($id)) {
                continue;
            }

            $e = new Country();

            $e->setId($id);
            $e->setName($country);

            //Doctrine manager is also available
            $this->manager->persist($e);

            $this->manager->flush();
        }

        $this->manager->clear();
    }

    public function getOrder() {
      return 0;
    }
}
```

## Loading a seed

The SeedBundle gives you two default commands and one for each seed you made. With the previous example, I'd have:

```
app/console seed:load #calls the load method of every seed
app/console seed:unload #calls the unload method of every seed
app/console seed:country
```

The global `seed:load` and `seed:unload` allow you to run multiple seeds in one command. You can of course skip seeds `app/console seed:load --skip Town` but also name the one you want `app/console seed:load Country`. For more informations, please use `app/console seed:load --help`.

## Seed order

Every seed has a `getOrder` method that is used to sort them. The default value is `0`.
